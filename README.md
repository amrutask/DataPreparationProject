# Salary prediction on New York Current Job Posting dataset from Kaggle

## Description
The project is on the application of data preprocessing techniques to make the dataset ready to be used in machine learning model for prediction.

## Technologies
* Python
* sklearn (scikit-learn)
* Tableau
* Random Forest Regression
* Decision regression Tree

## Dataset
Kaggle Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/new-york-city/new-york-city-current-job-postings

## Steps

* 1. Worked on data pre-processing steps like missing value imputation, outlier detection and dimension reduction using correlation analysis to make the dataset ready for machine learning model.

* 2. Used tableau to visualize the relation between predictor variables and the dependent variables.

* 3. Implemented random forest regression and decision regression tree in python to predict the salary variable.
